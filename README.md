## Daniel Dimick

AI Engineer and Enterprise Transformation Consultant bridging strategy, transformation, and technical implementation.

**What I build:** Fine-tuned SLMs, multi-agent architectures, RAG systems, and agentic workflows for enterprise AI.

**Featured Work:**

| Project | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| [Enterprise AI Case Study](https://deepdmk.github.io/enterprise-ai-case-study/) | Full enterprise AI transformation: McKinsey 7S through 14 fine-tuned models and a learned orchestrator. $163K vs. $2-7M vendor approaches. |
| [Multi-Agent Orchestration](https://github.com/deepdmk/multi-agent-orchestration-beeai) | 12-stage progression through agentic AI: tool integration, execution control, and multi-agent coordination. |
| [Video Transcript RAG System](https://github.com/deepdmk/video-transcript-rag-system) | RAG system with transcript extraction, FAISS semantic search, and Gradio interface powered by LangChain. |
| [LoRA Instruction Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/deepdmk/lora-instruction-finetuning) | Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA. Trains <1% of parameters with SACREBLEU evaluation. |
| [DPO Preference Alignment](https://github.com/deepdmk/dpo-preference-alignment) | Direct Preference Optimization with LoRA adapters and 4-bit quantization. |
| [Transformer Translation from Scratch](https://github.com/deepdmk/transformer-translation-from-scratch) | Full encoder-decoder transformer built from scratch in PyTorch. |
